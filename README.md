## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

On this project, i understood more on using CSS variables to increase work speed. See examples below:

```css
:root {
  --grey-background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --white-background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --paragraph-font: 15px;
  --pry-font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

I would love to imporve on my knowledge of media queries; especially writing less media query codes.
